Webfilter is a system for dynamically maintaining access control lists for
the Squid proxy server.

It allows the administrator to block access to certain web sites,
and open them for specified periods of time.

To set up:

1. Run filter-master as a daemon (it'll start an HTTP server on port 5001).

2. In your squid.conf file add the filter-helper and set up some access rules:

	external_acl_type webfilter ttl=60 %DST /path/to/filter-helper
	acl webfilter external webfilter
	http_access allow webfilter
	http_access deny all
